# ESP32 DHT11 Sensor Data Transmission

This repository contains code and instructions for connecting a DHT11 sensor to an ESP32 microcontroller and Atsign technology for e2e data transmission.

## Requirements

Before getting started, make sure you have the following:

- ESP32 microcontroller
- DHT11 sensor
- Breadboard
- 3 jumper wires
- Resistor
- Arduino IDE or PlatformIO
- Java/Flutter development environment

## Hardware Setup

1. Connect the DHT11 sensor to your ESP32 following the [wiring diagram](dht11-esp32-pinout.png).
  - You may also use the [IRL image](atTemperature-breadboard.png) of the wiring for reference
2. Follow the steps from the [esp32 setup](https://github.com/atsign-foundation/at_esp32#readme) guide.

## ESP32 Code Setup

1. Clone or download this repository to your development environment.
2. Follow the steps from the [esp32 setup](https://github.com/atsign-foundation/at_esp32#readme) guide.
3. Upload the code to your ESP32 and monitor.
